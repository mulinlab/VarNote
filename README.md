## VarNote
   VarNote is a tool to rapidly annotate genome-scale variants from large and complex functional annotation resources. VarNote is equipped by a novel index system and a parallel random-sweep searching algorithm. It shows substantial performance improvements to annotate human genetic variants at different scales. VarNote supports both region-based and allele-specific annotations for different file formats and equips many advanced functions for flexible annotations extraction. By integrating massive allele-specific annotations and our functional/pathogenic regulatory variant prediction models in VarNote web portal, biologists and clinicians can simply achieve fast and comprehensive functional/pathogenic regulatory variant/mutation prioritization using genome-scale inputs.

   - [Install, Quick Start and Usage](http://mulinlab.org/varnote/documentaiton.html "Install and Usage")
   - [VarNote Applications](http://mulinlab.org/varnote/application.html "VarNote Pipelines"): The advanced features of VarNote enable it can be extended to efficiently annotate and prioritize whole-genome non-coding variants in different genetic studies, such as GWAS downstream analysis and whole-genome sequencing of patients with inherited diseases. We leveraged VarNote programming APIs and large-scale variant annotations to provide three commonly-used applications, including:
     - VarNote-REG: prioritization of likely causal regulatory variants from GWAS results;
     - VarNote-PAT: prioritization of rare pathogenic regulatory variants from WES/WGS of patients with inherited diseases;
     - VarNote-CAN: prioritization of cancer driver regulatory mutations from tumor sequencing results.
   - We welcome any discussion, suggestion and potential contribution of new functional prediction scores through github or contact Dr. Mulin Jun Li (mulinli{at}connect.hku.hk).
